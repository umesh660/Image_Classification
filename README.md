<h2>Image Classification Model</h2>

<p>Developed an image classification model using Python, TensorFlow, and Keras in Google Colab, aimed at categorizing images into "Happy" and "Sad."</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>Data Preprocessing:</b> Validated image extensions and removed unsupported files to ensure data integrity and compatibility for model training.</li>
    <li><b>Model Development:</b> Built a convolutional neural network (CNN) using Keras Sequential API, with convolutional, max-pooling, and dense layers for effective feature extraction and classification.</li>
    <li><b>Model Training:</b> Split data into training, validation, and test sets using TensorFlow's dataset API. Trained the model with the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss, monitoring validation performance to avoid overfitting.</li>
    <li><b>Model Evaluation:</b> Achieved 93.5% accuracy on the test set, with comprehensive evaluation metrics including precision, recall, and binary accuracy.</li>
    <li><b>Prediction Demonstration:</b> Demonstrated the model's capability to predict "Happy" or "Sad" on new images, showcasing its practical application.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Outcome:</b> Successfully developed a high-accuracy image classification model, advancing the use of deep learning for image analysis tasks.</p>
